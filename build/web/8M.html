Contemporary home designs enjoyed their highest levels of popularity during the 1970s, but the style still retains its appeal today. Pure contemporary home plans display such eye-catching features as asymmetrical design, unusual angles, flat roofs with varied or multi-level rooflines,boldly articulated windows, silo-like towers, little ornamentation and vertical siding. Contemporary home design is, in fact, a post-modern interpretation of the modernist mindset, which pared buildings down to stark edifices with little warmth. Today's contemporary home plans include references to traditional architecture, albeit redefined and reinterpreted.
